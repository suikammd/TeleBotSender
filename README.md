#### Let TeleBot Send To Others

TeleBot acts as a forwarder, you can use this to forward any kinds of telegram messages to others just by adding handlers using  [telebot](https://github.com/tucnak/telebot).

It seems that this [telebot](https://github.com/tucnak/telebot) doesn't support forward album, so I use very ugly methods to sovle this problem by using many global variables hhhh. 

Check [handler](https://github.com/suikammd/teleBotSender/blob/master/handler.go) to give me some advice, thx.
